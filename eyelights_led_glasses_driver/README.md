This folder contains experiments related to the "Led Glasses" from ADABox 020.

Hope to combine a number of features:
- bluetooth as control
- used as a scoreboard for volleyball
- control color of each side
- scroll some messages
- use IOS App, Adafruit BlueConnect app
    - uart for general CLI
    - color picker (TODO: how to combine "Packet" with raw serial)
- tap example into a double-tap to turn on/off
- can I use orientation example to turn on


Some features I really don't care about:
- the silk screen (sorry Lady Ada)
- the shape
- used as glasses
- as an introvert, I really don't like the attention
